/* A company that wants to send data over the Internet
has asked you to write a program that will encrypt it
so that it may be transmitted more securely. All the
data is transmitted as four-digit integers. Your
application should read a four-digit integer entered by
the user and encrypt it as follows: Replace each digit
with the result of adding 7 to the digit and getting the
remainder after dividing the new value by 10. Then swap
the first digit with the third, and swap the second digit
with the fourth. Then print the encrypted integer. Your
application should also allow the user to enter an
encrypted four-digit integer and then decrypt it (by
reversing the encryption scheme) to form the
original number. */
